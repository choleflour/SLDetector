# Sign Language Detector  

## What it does  
I built a **Sign Language Detector** that classifies images of sign language gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By collecting and preprocessing image datasets, I trained a model to recognize different hand signs with high accuracy. The goal was to make sign language recognition more accessible and efficient for real-world applications.  

## How I built it  
I did a lot of research to determine the best approach, exploring different machine learning models before implementing a CNN-based solution. The process included:  
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gathering and cleaning image datasets of sign language gestures to improve model performance.  
- **Model Training**: Training a CNN to classify sign language images with high accuracy.  
- **Deployment & Testing**: While the model performed well on static images, accuracy dropped when I integrated it with a real-time camera feed, revealing challenges in real-world applications.  

## What I learned  
This project taught me a lot about machine learning, dataset preparation, and model optimization. More importantly, I realized how much I learn through **hands-on experience**. The transition from classifying static images to real-time detection was more challenging than expected, showing me the importance of real-world testing and iterative improvements.  

## What's next for Sign Language Detector  
To improve real-time accuracy, I plan to:  
- **Enhance data augmentation** to make the model more robust to variations in lighting, angles, and hand positions.  
- **Explore alternative architectures**, such as Transformers or hybrid CNN-RNN models, for better sequence prediction.  
- **Optimize real-time processing** by selecting key video frames and reducing latency.  
- **Expand the dataset** to include a more diverse range of sign language gestures for better generalization.  

This project was an exciting and rewarding experience, and I'm excited to continue refining and improving it!
